## LLAMA 2 - Android [Proof of Concept]
This repository contains an Android implementation (along with other materials), that I created to understand how viable local LLM inferencing is on mobile devices, specifically with regards to the Llama 2 Architecture.

It is directly inspired (and based) on the project [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) by [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)

Please read the following article for understanding this project :
